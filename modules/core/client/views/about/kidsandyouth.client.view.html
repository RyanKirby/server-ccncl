          We have a parent’s room where parents can look after their young children and still listen to the sermon via a live audio feed. This room is stocked with tea and coffee and some toys for the little ones!

          We have a team of trained kids work volunteers to look after children, over 18 months, throughout the service. Each week the children follow an engaging, gospel centred programme. They are encouraged to have fun and be creative all whilst learning more of who Jesus. All you have to do is sign them in at the “Check in” area and sign them back out at 12pm, the kids work team will do the rest!

          We have recently begun working with a group of young people just outside the city centre in Hebburn. We provide a youth club on a Friday night from 7pm, this has been a wonderful opportunity to engage with the community in Hebburn and introduce people to Jesus! To find out more or get involved chat to the church pastors. </p>
